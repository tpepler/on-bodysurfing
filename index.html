<h2>Quotes</h2>

<blockquote>
<i>I knew my old man would raise a horrible stink on account of being a non-swimmer and getting stomach spasms already when I do a little body-surfing.</i><br>-- Gidget<!--, Chapter 2, p19, 2001 paperback edition-->
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<i>I had a style of bodysurfing the Wedge, where I'd drop in on my side, like it was a rail, and curve it to be the right shape to go up and down the wave. Most people plane with one arm back, one arm over, but I rode on my shoulder, like it was a rail.</i><br>-- Joe Quigg<!--, Turning Points; interview with Steve Pezman, Surferâ€™s Journal 20.6-->
