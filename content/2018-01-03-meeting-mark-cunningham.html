It was a bright morning in early November when I drove our rental car up to La Jolla to check out the surf at Boomers. I told my half-asleep wife that I'll be back by about noon when I left our hotel in Shelter Island Drive. The plan was to visit Sea World in the afternoon of our last day in San Diego, before our flight back to the UK on the following day.
</p>

<p>
There is still plenty of parking space when I arrive at La Jolla cove. I am still slightly annoyed about being fined two days ago for not cramping the car's front wheel to the curb. Sure, there was a sign warning people to do so, but I had to search the internet that evening to find out what the term 'curbing' even meant. Those in the know discussing the topic on internet fora generally advised to accept that I was in the wrong and move on, as the San Diego council will not budge from their stance on this matter.
</p>

<p>
Walking across the grass to the cliff at Boomers, camera in hand, I see that the surf has risen to about 6-8 feet, maybe bigger. There are a handful of guys in the water picking off waves breaking in both directions from the peak. Being unfamiliar with the break, I watch from the cliff edge, waiting to see where the locals enter and exit the water. After a while, Chris Kalima swims in and climbs a steep footpath in the cliff edge toward my right. I recognise him from Come Hell or High Water, Keith Malloy's film about bodysurfing which came out about five years ago.
</p>

<p>
Excitement rises in my chest as I realise that the white-haired bodysurfer still in the water is none other than Mark Cunningham. His understated style is recognisable even from the distance. He takes off on a left breaking wave and rides it in to shore, removing his swim fins on the pebbles at the water edge before following in Kalima's steps up the footpath.
</p>

<p>
He starts talking to a couple of guys in a shady spot overlooking Boomers, and I overhear their conversation as I pluck up the courage to go over there. It's now or never---when will I get another chance at meeting Mark Cunningham?
</p>

<p>
``Hi mister Cunningham, my name is Theo. Would you mind if I take a photo with you?"
</p>

<p>
``No, not at all", he replies. ``Have you gone out?"
</p>

<p>
``I was thinking about it, until I saw you in the water and thought that the surf might be quite serious."
</p>

<p>
``Nah, I'm a rookie", he grins with characteristic humility.
</p>

<p>
I hand my camera to the nearest person, who happens to be Hal Handley, another bodysurfing legend. He is all suited up and ready to get in the water.
</p>

<p>
``You should really have the sheriff in the photo", Mark jokes, referring to Hal.
</p>

<p>
Holding the camera at arms length, Hal squints as he takes a couple of photos and then hands it back to me.
</p>

<p>
``So where are you from?", Mark asks me.
</p>

<p>
``South Africa."
</p>

<p>
``So you're a bru'tjie?"
</p>

<p>
``Yes, I am", I reply, not knowing what else to say. For the first time in my life, I feel really starstruck. My mind is just blank.
</p>

<p>
There was not enough time left to go out for a surf and get back to the hotel before noon, and no way to contact my wife to let her know of any change in plans. The surf was still pumping, so I watched from the cliff for a little while longer before getting back into my rental car. Meeting Mark Cunningham made up for missing a couple of waves, I guess.
